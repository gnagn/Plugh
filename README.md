## What is it?

Just for fun, I'm working on an implementation of a [Z-machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine). 

I'm working from the [standards document](http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html), 
with assistance from Eric Lippert's [series of blog entries on implementing a Z-machine in OCaml](https://ericlippert.com/category/zmachine/).

This is just a fun project, mostly for practice and for exploring corners of C++ I haven't worked with before.
